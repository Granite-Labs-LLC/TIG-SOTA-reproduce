// TIG's UI uses the pattern `tig_challenges::<challenge_name>` to automatically detect your algorithm's challenge

// when launching kernels, you should not exceed this const or else it may not be deterministic

// stat_filter
//
// Filtering based on Median Absolute Deviation (MAD):
// We compute the median of all L2 norms, then calculate the MAD (median of
// absolute deviations from the median). The threshold is set to:
//      norm_threshold = scale_factor × MAD × 1.4826
// The factor 1.4826 scales MAD to match the standard deviation for normally
// distributed data. This makes the filter more robust to outliers compared to
// filtering methods based on mean and standard deviation, which are more
// sensitive to extreme values.
